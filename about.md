I’m an entrepreneur who can be the salesman, marketer, product designer, programmer — whatever it takes to build and grow a business.  

What makes the business remarkable is the team.

  

I believe real growth comes from investing in people — whether it’s mentoring a startup founder, backing a passionate team, or simply giving someone the space to lead.

  

Before founding Jinoby, I worked across a spectrum of industries — investment banking, insurance, aviation, medical equipment, and outdoor media — building systems that solved real business problems.  

Each domain taught me something new: about people, systems, and how to bring ideas to life.

  

I learn from colleagues, from books, from movies, from traveling — every experience is a lesson.  

The more I see, the more I realize how much there still is to learn.

  

And for me, learning is only one side of the equation.  

The engineer in me thrives on applying those lessons to build something meaningful.
