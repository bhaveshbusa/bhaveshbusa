title: "Distance to customer for product teams"

I was once asked: _What’s the secret to building a successful product?_

At the time, I hadn’t deeply reflected on what drove our product’s success. My instinctive, System 1 response was: **“We were very close to the customer.”**

After giving it more thought (System 2 in action), I realized that gut response was spot on: **distance to customer is the key to building successful products.**

### **What is “Distance to Customer”?**  

**Distance to customer** is a measure of how directly a product team interacts with the end user — how much first-hand exposure they have to customer needs, pain points, and feedback.

### **The Forward Deployed Engineer Model**

In a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAUg4ywB2f7usPEmZAoCrkwqwNe5S8Cq79I), Lenny Rachitsky shares a conversation with Nabeel S. Qureshi (ex-Palantir), who describes the **Forward Deployed Engineer** (FDE) role. An FDE is a unique blend of software engineer and customer partner. They’re embedded directly with the customer, translating needs into solutions in real time and building trust with the customer.

### **Implications for Product Teams**

While most product teams don’t have FDEs, they do rely on other feedback mechanisms: support tickets, feature requests, sales inputs, and so on. But with each layer removed from the customer, the risk of distortion grows. The key is to:

- **Shorten the distance wherever possible**: direct interviews, customer shadowing, usage analytics.
    
- **Watch for signal-to-noise degradation**: not all feedback is equally useful.
  

### **Bring the customer in**

If you can’t send engineers to the customer, bring the customer to the team.

In my experience, **customers love talking directly to developers**. It builds trust, excitement — and better outcomes.  

Think about it: wouldn’t you love to speak directly to the chef at your favourite restaurant and share your thoughts?
